# Using Editor Placeholder

<info-box info="">
	This feature was introduced in CKEditor 4.15 and is provided through the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/editorplaceholder">Editor Placeholder</a> plugin that is included in the Standard and Full presets available from the official CKEditor <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site. You can also {@link guide/dev/plugins/README add it to your custom build} with the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">online builder</a>.
</info-box>

The Editor Placeholder plugin allows you to display a placeholder text when the editor content is empty.
